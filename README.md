scripts
=======
This is a collection of (more or less) usefull small scripts I made. Fell free to use/exten/ignore. 

fetch_imap
----------
Python script for fetching emails from an IMAP inbox and saving the attachments in directories. 

VCDdump
-------
Python script for the Raspberry Pi dumping the Activity of GPIO pins to a VCD file that can be read by e.g. GTKWave.
